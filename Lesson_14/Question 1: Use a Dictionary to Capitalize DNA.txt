Write a small python program that takes in one system argument: a DNA sequence. You will convert that sequence to uppercase and print out the changed sequence. In this example you can assume the user will enter a valid DNA sequence that can consist of both upper or lowercase letters. You should use a dictionary to do the conversion. The dictionary should have four keys, each one a lower case letter, and store the uppercase of the letter as the value.

You may not use string.upper() or string.replace().

You must call your dictionary "caps"

We will test your code with the following commands:

python3 studentcode.py AaTtCcGg
python3 studentcode.py gctaAcGtCA
The expected output for those commands is:

AATTCCGG
GCTAACGTCA
