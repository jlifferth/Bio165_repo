System arguments are stored as a list. Given an unknown number of system arguments, split the list of system arguments into two different lists: one that has the even numbers and one that has the odd numbers. Print the list with even numbers in ascending order on one line and the list with odd numbers in ascending order on the next line. Just print the lists (no special formatting). You must use a for loop.

We will run your code with the following commands:

python3 studentcode.py 1 4 2 90 5 3 9
python3 studentcode.py 903 901 109283 121 1
The expected output for this program would be:

[2, 4, 90]
[1, 3, 5, 9]
[]
[1, 121, 901, 903, 109283]
