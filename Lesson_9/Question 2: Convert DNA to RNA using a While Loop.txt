Your program will accept one system argument: a DNA sequence (may contain upper/lower case letters or spaces). You may not use string.replace() for this practice. Remove all the white spaces and convert the 'T' and 't' nucleotides to 'U'. You must use a while loop.

We will test your code with the following commands:

python3 studentcode.py "a t TT gG aT aa"
python3 studentcode.py "cc cC tt TTt gaTc"
The expected output from these commands is:

AUUUGGAUAA
CCCCUUUUUGAUC
