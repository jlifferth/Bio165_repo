Your program will accept two command line arguments: a DNA sequence which consists of two exons separated by an intron, and the position in the sequence where the first exon ends, followed by a comma, followed by the position in the sequence where the second exon starts. The goal is to remove the intron and just put the two exons together. Hint: convert the exon end and start positions into a list to parse the numbers.

We will test your code with the following commands:

python3 studentcode.py ATATTTGTAAA 3,7
python3 studentcode.py GCGTGTAATGCGTATTG 2,8
The expected output for your program is:

ATAGTAAA
GCATGCGTATTG
