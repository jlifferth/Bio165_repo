Your code will accept two command line arguments: two sequences of DNA. You should compare them and tell the user whether or not they are the same sequence.

We will test your code using the following commands:

python3 studentcode.py ATCGA ATCGA
python3 studentcode.py TGTGTAC TGA
The correct output from those tests would be:

They are the same sequence.
They are not the same sequence.
