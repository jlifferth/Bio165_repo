Your program will accept two command line arguments: one with your first name and one with your last. You should store each of these arguments as a separate variable. Compare the lengths of your first and last names and print a message that tells which of your names is longest or tells you if your names are the same length.

We will test your code using the following commands:

python3 studentcode.py Chuck Norris
python3 studentcode.py Perry Ridge
python3 studentcode.py Taylor Swift
Your code should output the following:

Norris is longer than Chuck.
Perry is the same length as Ridge.
Taylor is longer than Swift.
