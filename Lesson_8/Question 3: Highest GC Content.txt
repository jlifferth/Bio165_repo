Your code will accept three command line arguments: three DNA sequences. You need to print the one that has the highest GC content.

We will test your code using the following commands:

python3 studentcode.py ATCG GCGCGC ATTATAA
python3 studentcode.py CGCGGG ATATA TTGTC
python3 studentcode.py ATTGT GTATA GGGGCCGCC
The expected output from these commands is:

GCGCGC has the highest GC content.
CGCGGG has the highest GC content.
GGGGCCGCC has the highest GC content.
