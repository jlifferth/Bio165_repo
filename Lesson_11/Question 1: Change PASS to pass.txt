We are looking for lines that have "PASS" in the 7th column. Remember that header lines start with "#". Find all the header lines and lines that have the word "PASS" in the 7th column. Replace "PASS" with "pass", using a regular expression, and then print those lines to a new file. The input file name will be provided as the first system argument. The output file name is the second system argument.

The test file can be found on Marylou here:

/fslgroup/fslg_BIO165/test.vcf
We will test your code with the following command:

python3 studentcode.py input.vcf output.vcf
You must use re.sub to change PASS to pass.
